1. I didn't ask user if he/she would like to guess a letter or whole word(s), if user will write more than one letter it automatically will realise that this is a word.
2. In countries_and_capitals file for capital of Paraguay - " Asunción" it used not "o" letter but "ó" so it's impossible to guess this word.
3. In 7th requirement its written "if player will reached his/her life points program should display a hint", I make it, when player have only one life left it shows the hint
4. In 9th requirement - name| date | guessing_time | guessing_tries | guessed_word (i.e. Marcin | 26.10.2016 14:15 | 45 | Warsaw). The requirement and example are different. so I made  name| date | guessing_time | guessing_tries | guessed_word and sorted by time and if time is the same. next sorting is by tries.

I work with computers whole my life, and when I need some program for work I started coding. For now its just for myself, because I like it
